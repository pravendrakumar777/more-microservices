# more-microservices
This repository contains a complete microservices-based architecture developed using REST APIs. It includes the following components.

1.-> API-Gateway: Handles routing, authentication, and centralized access to all microservices.

2.-> Hotel-Service: Manages hotel-related data and operations.

3.-> User-Service: Handles user information and functionality.

4.-> Rating-Service: Manages ratings and reviews for hotels by users.

5.-> Service-Registry (Eureka Server): Provides service discovery and registration for all microservices.

6.-> Config-Service: Centralized configuration management for all microservices using Spring Cloud Config.

All microservices are built with Spring Boot and follow a modular and scalable architecture for easy deployment and maintenance.
